This repository documents explorations in mathematical neuroscience:
specifically, numerical models of networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons.

The `fhn` directory contains the Jupyter notebook used to create the
simulations.

The `paper` directory contains the final paper presenting our findings.

The `lib` directory contains the visualizations and figures created using these
semulations.
